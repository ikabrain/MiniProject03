## 📌 Overview of the problem(s)
### **1. Problem Statement:**
- Find all the subsets from a set of numbers whose sum is zero.
- **Constraint:** Subset size must be 5
- Set={-12, -3, -6, 7, 2, -2, 6, 3, 9, -7, -5, -8, 1, 11, -9, -4}

### **2. Problem Statement:**
- Find all the subsets from a set of numbers whose sum is zero.
- **Constraint:** Subset size must be 3 to 6 only
- Set={-12, -3, -6, 7, 2, -2, 6, 3, 9, -7, -5, -8, 1, 11, -9, -4}
